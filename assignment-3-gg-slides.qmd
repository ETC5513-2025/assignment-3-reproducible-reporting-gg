## Background

- Studying abroad offers new experiences and better education  
- But high costs make it difficult for many families  
- More students go to the U.S., U.K., or Australia  
- Family income gaps make overseas study a luxury for some  
- This report looks at how money affects decisions  
  and how we can reduce financial barriers

## Problem Introduction

👤 A student from the United States  
🎓 Wants to study a Master of Computer Science at Monash University  
💰 Annual budget: USD 42,355.90，fully supported by his parents

📌 The question is:  
Is this budget enough to pay for tuition, rent, and living costs  
in Melbourne for one year?

This simple example helps us understand the real financial challenges faced by many international students.

- 🎓 Tuition and rent projected to 2025 using 4.75% annual inflation (IMF forecasts for advanced economies)
  + Annual Tuition = Tuition_USD / Duration_Years × 1.0475
  + Annual Rent = Rent_USD × 12 × 1.0475

## Results  {.smaller}

- Monash University ranks in the **lower tier**, with an affordability ratio of **0.751**.

- While tuition fee is moderate, **high rent (USD 21,369/year)** and **living expenses (USD 12,912/year)** raise the total cost and make affordability ratio falling.

- These highlights how **non-tuition costs drive affordability issues** for international students.
