## Result for each figure

### Figure 1- Tuition Fee

Monash University's tuition fee for the entire two-year program is USD 42,800.  
Compared to other universities, Monash slightly above the meadian, with many U.S. and U.K. universities charging over USD 50,000.  
This suggests that Monash offers a relatively more affordable tuition fee for master programs among English-speaking countries.  
For computer science is two-year duration, the annual tuition fee is USD 21,400.

Several European and Latin American universities, such as University of Sao Paulo, Goethe University, and University of Oslo, etc., show a tuition fee of USD 0 in the dataset. This likely reflects the real-world policy of these public universities offering free or nearly free education to international students. However, in some cases, this may also indicate missing or non-standardized data. We treat these values as valid representations of low-cost or no-tuition programs.

### Figure 2- Living Cost Index

Figure 2 presents the normalized Living Cost Index, where New York City is assigned a baseline value of 100.

Monash University is located in Melbourne and the courses of computer science are mainly in Clayton. The day-by-day living cost index is 72.8. This means with real-world data from [NUMBEO](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/New-York), which reports the average monthly living cost for single person (excluding rent) in New York City as USD 1,709.20 and in Melbourne as USD 1,244.30. 
It indicates that daily expenses such as food, transportation, and utilities in Melbourne are relatively manageable than major global cities.

As a result, Monash students are less likely to encounter excessive living costs compare to other universities for international study.
