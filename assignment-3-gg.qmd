## Conclusion

This report evaluated the total cost of a USA student with a budget of **USD 43,593.90** studying a Master of Computer Science at Monash University. By analyzing tuition fees, rent, living expenses, visa, and insurance costs across global universities which have master of computer science.

Our analysis shows that Monash University’s tuition fee of a year is **USD 21,400** which is relatively moderate compared to U.S. and U.K. universities. The cost of living index in Melbourne (72.8) and Numbeo’s estimated monthly expenses (USD 1,244.3) support the city’s living cost as a reasonably affordable location for international students. The living cost of a year will be estimated as **14,931.6** However, monthly rent of USD 1,700 significantly increases the total cost over the an year duration, reaching an estimated **USD 20,400** for single living per year. Combined with **visa (USD 450)** and **insurance fees (USD 650)**, the total cost is **USD 57831.6**, which is **well above** the budget.

Therefore, under current assumptions, pursuing this degree at Monash would **likely impose a financial burden** unless supplementary funding options such as scholarships, shared housing, or part-time employment are secured.

We recommend that prospective international students conduct a detailed cost breakdown when planning to study abroad, considering not only tuition but also living and setup costs. University like Monash remain attractive due to their academic reputation and moderate tuition, but total affordability depends on each student’s financial context.
