## Executive Summary

This report investigates whether a U.S. student applying to the Master of Computer Science program at Monash University can afford the associated costs.
The studentâ€™s parents are willing to provide full financial support, with an annual budget of USD 43,593.9.
By calculating and comparing tuition, rent, visa, and insurance expenses over two years, we estimate the total cost at approximately USD 84,700.
The results indicate that while the budget is sufficient, the choice may still impose noticeable financial pressure on the family.
