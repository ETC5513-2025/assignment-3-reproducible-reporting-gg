## Result for each figure

### Figure 1- Tuition Fee

Monash University's tuition fee for the entire two-year program is USD 42,800.  
Compared to other universities, Monash slightly above the meadian, with many U.S. and U.K. universities charging over USD 50,000.  
This suggests that Monash offers a relatively more affordable tuition fee for master programs among English-speaking countries.  
For computer science is two-year duration, the annual tuition fee is USD 21,400.

Several European and Latin American universities, such as University of Sao Paulo, Goethe University, and University of Oslo, etc., show a tuition fee of USD 0 in the dataset. This likely reflects the real-world policy of these public universities offering free or nearly free education to international students. However, in some cases, this may also indicate missing or non-standardized data. We treat these values as valid representations of low-cost or no-tuition programs.

### Figure 2- Living Cost Index

Figure 2 presents the normalized Living Cost Index, where New York City is assigned a baseline value of 100.

Monash University is located in Melbourne and the courses of computer science are mainly in Clayton. The day-by-day living cost index is 72.8. This means with real-world data from [NUMBEO](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/New-York), which reports the average monthly living cost for single person (excluding rent) in New York City as USD 1,709.20 and in Melbourne as USD 1,244.30. 
It indicates that daily expenses such as food, transportation, and utilities in Melbourne are relatively manageable than major global cities.

As a result, Monash students are less likely to encounter excessive living costs compare to other universities for international study.

### Figure 3- Rent

Students at Monash pay around USD 1,700 per month in rent.

This number is in the first quintile of the whole dataset, which means though the rent is lower than cities such as Cambridge, L.A. and Sydney, the rent still may be a burden for the budget. 

The total rental expenses over a two-year program may sum up to USD 40,800, which forms the largest portion of non-tuition expenses.

### Figure 4- Visa

The visa application fee required for international students varies by country and it is necessary.

For Monash University, the Australian student visa fee is USD 450, according to the dataset. This is quiet high, with only a country is higher like the United Kingdom charging up to USD 485, while some European countries charge as little as USD 75 and USA is 160.

Although a one-time fee, visa costs still contribute to the total pre-departure expenses. Australia's fee is not among the lowest, but it is unlikely to pose a major barrier relative to larger ongoing expenses like tuition fee or rent.

Given our case budget of USD 43,593.9, this visa fee constitutes roughly 1% of the total cost, but still a necessary consideration in the budgeting process.

### Figure 5- Insurance Fee

Oversea Student Health Covers (OSHC) is another non-negligible and one-time cost and that varies significantly across countries and institutions.

The insurance cost for studying at Monash University is estimated at USD 650, which is required for the full 2-year program. This value is close to the median.

Insurance is an essential expense that ensures students have access to healthcare during their stay. Its value is especially important in countries like Australia, where OSHC is a visa requirement.

For our budget-focused analysis, this one-time cost is modest but necessary. When paired with visa fees, they cost total USD 1,100, which should be accounted for in advance planning.

### Result of the report

The following figure compares the total estimated cost of pursuing a Master of Computer Science across selected universities

**Figure 1** illustrates the estimated total cost of completing a Master of Computer Science at selected global universities. Monash University appears in the **upper-middle range** of the cost distribution, with a total approaching **USD 58,000** for one academic year. While Monash's tuition remains moderate, Melbourneâ€™s housing cost positions the university above budget-constrained thresholds. In contrast, institutions in Germany and Norway, which offer low or no tuition fees, fall significantly below Monash. These findings highlight the role of rent and living expenses in shaping the overall affordability of international education choices.
